Haunted House

::Beginnings
You are in a small, dimly lit room. There is a door in front of you. You hear a faint voice coming from the other side of the door. It says, "I am the ghost of the house. I will grant you one wish. What is your wish?"
[Try to open the door](Another room)

::Another room
The door opens to another room. You see a desk with a large, dusty book.
[Open the book](The book of spells)
